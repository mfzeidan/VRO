# VRO

The goal of this repo is to allow volleyball coaches the opportunity to maximize how optimal their volleyball rotation can be based off the skill levels of the players at their disposal

ideally a frontend will be placed at the front of this, along with rotation strategy selections to maximize player value on the court throughout an entire rotation
